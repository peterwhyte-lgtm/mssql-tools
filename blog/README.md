    index.md                         template — copy this for new posts

```

## How to add a new post

1. Copy the `_template/` folder and rename it to the post slug (e.g. `tempdb-usage/`)
2. Rename nothing else — the post file is always `index.md` inside the folder
3. Fill in the frontmatter in `index.md` — title, slug, seo fields, and which scripts it features
4. Write the post following the template sections
5. Add screenshots to the `images/` subfolder and update the `<img>` tags in the post
6. Fill in the SEO block at the bottom before publishing
7. Add a row to the index table above
8. Publish to sqldba.blog when ready

## Content guidelines

- Lead with the DBA problem, not the script
- Include the complete SQL so readers can copy it into SSMS without visiting the repo
- Show the `run.ps1` command for readers who have the repo cloned
- Use `<img src="images/filename.png" alt="..." title="...">` for all post images (not Markdown `![]()`)
- Alt text ≤125 chars, descriptive, includes the focus keyphrase naturally
- Image title ≤60 chars
- Meta description 150–160 chars
- Explain each output column that is non-obvious
- Give threshold guidance — what counts as a problem and what to do about it
- End with the GitHub link and related scripts

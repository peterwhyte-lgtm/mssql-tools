# Script Templates

Use these as the standard format for new DBA scripts.

## SQL Script Template

-- Purpose: Describe what the script checks or fixes.
-- Use: Copy into SSMS and run against the target instance or database.
-- Prerequisites: Mention required permissions, database context, or connected instance.
-- Notes: Mention expected output, caveats, and what action the DBA should take next.

## Script Standards We Want to Keep

- Keep scripts simple and production-friendly.
- Prefer SSMS-first SQL scripts for investigation and reporting.
- Add brief comments at the top for purpose, use, and expected output.
- Make PowerShell helpers easy to run locally without extra setup.

Script Name : Get-ProxyAndCredentials
Category    : security
Purpose     : Lists SQL Agent proxies and server-level credentials with their identity
              and associated subsystems. Proxies that use stored credentials to run Agent
              steps under a different account are a common privilege escalation path.

/*
  DESIGN: Two row sources unified via UNION ALL:
    1. SQL Agent proxies (msdb.dbo.sysproxies) — run steps under an alternate Windows account
    2. Server-level credentials (sys.credentials) — used by proxies, linked servers, and BACKUP
  The subsystem list for each proxy is aggregated from msdb.dbo.sysproxysubsystem.
  Credential identity is the Windows account or certificate the credential maps to.

# Helpers

This folder is the quick-access layer for the DBA repo during day-to-day operations, local validation, and AI-assisted troubleshooting.
It is the first place to go when you want to run, inspect, or route a script without digging through the full repo tree.

## What belongs here

- Repo navigation and triage helpers
- Local SQL connectivity and script execution helpers
- Output cleanup and task routing utilities

## Useful commands

From the repo root, the short forms are now:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 Get-WaitStatistics
.\run.ps1 Get-LongRunningQueries
.\run.ps1 powershell\reporting\Get-WaitStatistics.ps1
```

You can also call the helper directly:

```powershell
.\helpers\Run-Helper.ps1 -ScriptName Get-WaitStatistics
.\helpers\Run-Helper.ps1 -ScriptPath .\powershell\reporting\Get-WaitStatistics.ps1
```

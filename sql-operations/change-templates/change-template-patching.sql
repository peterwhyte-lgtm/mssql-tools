-- POST-PATCH VALIDATION
-- Run AFTER the patch is applied and services have restarted
-- ============================================================

-- 1. Confirm new version

-- 3. Confirm all databases are online
SELECT
    name,
    state_desc,
    recovery_model_desc
FROM sys.databases
WHERE state_desc <> 'ONLINE'
ORDER BY name;

-- 4. Check error log for issues since restart
EXEC xp_readerrorlog 0, 1, N'Error', NULL, NULL, NULL, N'desc';

-- 5. Spot-check key sp_configure settings survived the patch
SELECT
    name,
    value_in_use
FROM sys.configurations

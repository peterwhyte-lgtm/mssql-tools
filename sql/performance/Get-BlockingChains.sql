Script Name : Get-BlockingChains
Category    : diagnostics
Purpose     : Traces all active blocking chains using a recursive CTE. Returns
              every session involved in blocking — head blockers, mid-chain
              nodes, and leaf victims — ordered so each chain reads depth-first.
              Idle head blockers (sleeping but holding locks) are included; their
              last executed statement is recovered via sys.dm_exec_connections.
              Returns no rows when the server is not blocked.

Performance note: dm_exec_requests is materialised into #ar once to avoid
repeated DMV scans. downstream_waiters is pre-aggregated rather than computed
via a correlated subquery. dm_exec_connections is joined only for sessions
that have no active request (idle head blockers).

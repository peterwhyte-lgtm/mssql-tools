/*
Script Name : Get-QueryStoreForcedPlans
Category    : performance
Purpose     : Forced plans in Query Store with failure counts, plan age, forcing reason,
              and whether the forced plan is still the cheapest available option.
              A force_failure_count > 0 means QS is silently reverting to natural plans —
              queries you think are protected are not.
              Run in the context of the target database (-Database <dbname>).

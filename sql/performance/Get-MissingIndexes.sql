Script Name : Get-MissingIndexes
Category    : performance-troubleshooting
Purpose     : Missing index candidates from DMVs, ranked by impact score (seeks x cost x impact).
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog)
Safe        : Read-only
Impact      : Low
Requires    : VIEW SERVER STATE, VIEW ANY DATABASE
Notes       : Impact scores reset on SQL Server restart. Review carefully — DMVs suggest
              individual queries; creating every suggestion causes index bloat and write overhead.

-- Fixes : the suggested_statement column contains the ready-to-run CREATE INDEX command

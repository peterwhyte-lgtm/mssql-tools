Script Name : Get-LockEscalationStats
Category    : performance
Purpose     : Shows tables with the most lock escalations since last restart.
              Lock escalation converts row/page locks to a table lock, increasing blocking.

/*
  DESIGN: sys.dm_db_index_operational_stats with NULL parameters covers all databases
  and all indexes. Aggregated per table (summing across all indexes) since escalation
  is a table-level event. Excludes system databases (database_id <= 4).

  High escalation counts on a table indicate:
    - Large batch operations scanning many rows (e.g. bulk updates, large deletes)
    - Queries that acquire more than 5,000 row/page locks in a single statement
  Remedies:
    - ALTER TABLE t SET (LOCK_ESCALATION = DISABLE) — prevents escalation (use carefully)
    - Batch large DML into smaller chunks to stay below the lock threshold
    - Add covering indexes to reduce rows scanned per operation
    - Use READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT isolation to eliminate shared locks on reads

/*
Script Name : Get-ImplicitConversions
Category    : performance
Purpose     : Scans the plan cache for implicit conversion warnings. These cause index range
              scans instead of seeks and generate unnecessary CPU. Most common cause: VARCHAR
              column compared to NVARCHAR parameter, or INT column compared to VARCHAR.
              NOTE: scans plan XML — runs for 10–30 seconds on busy servers with large plan caches.

/*
Script Name : Get-MemoryGrantSpills
Category    : performance
Purpose     : Top queries by memory grant spills to TempDB. Spills occur when SQL grants
              less memory than a sort or hash join operator needs, forcing intermediate
              results to disk. Invisible in wait stats — shows as TempDB I/O pressure
              or RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE waits. Requires SQL Server 2016+ (total_spills column).

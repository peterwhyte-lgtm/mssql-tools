Script Name : Get-QueryStoreTopQueries
Category    : performance
Purpose     : Top queries from Query Store by CPU, duration, execution count, or plan regressions.
              Change @sort_by at the top to switch modes. Must run in the context of the target
              database — change the database in SSMS or pass -Database <dbname> via the PS wrapper.

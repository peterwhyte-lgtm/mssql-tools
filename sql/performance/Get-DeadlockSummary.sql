Script Name : Get-DeadlockSummary
Category    : performance-troubleshooting
Purpose     : Show recent deadlock events from the system_health XEvent ring buffer.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog)
Safe        : Read-only
Impact      : Low
Requires    : VIEW SERVER STATE
Notes       : Ring buffer holds recent events only (typically last 30–60 min). For full
              history, query the system_health .xel files directly in SSMS.

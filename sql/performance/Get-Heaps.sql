/*
Script Name : Get-Heaps
Category    : performance
Purpose     : Lists tables with no clustered index (heaps) across all online user databases.
              Heaps cause full table scans on every non-covering lookup, accumulate
              forwarded records after row updates (degrading IO), and do not reclaim
              deleted row space without a REBUILD. Common source of hidden IO pressure
              that grows silently as data volumes increase.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog)
Requires    : VIEW DATABASE STATE (iterates each user database)
Notes       : Small read-only lookup tables as heaps are usually acceptable.
              Prioritise by reserved_mb and forwarded_fetch_count.
              forwarded_fetch_count = how often SQL Server chased a forwarded-record pointer
              since the last restart (IO cost; forwarded_fetch_count was removed in SS 2025).
              has_primary_key = 0 means no PK exists at all — highest priority to fix.
              Fix: add a clustered index on the natural key, or add an identity
              column and cluster on that if no natural candidate exists.

Script Name : Get-PlanCacheHealth

Purpose     : Summarises plan cache composition by object type — highlights single-use
              plan bloat, ad-hoc SQL pressure, and total memory consumption. High
              single-use percentages indicate parameter sniffing or missing parameterisation.

  DESIGN: Three sections:
    1. By plan type — aggregate counts, single-use ratio, memory per objtype
    2. Top memory-consuming single-use ad-hoc plans — worst offenders for cleanup
    3. Overall cache health indicators
  Single-use plans (usecounts = 1) waste cache memory and indicate ad-hoc workloads.
  Remedies: OPTIMIZE FOR AD HOC WORKLOADS, sp_executesql, or forced parameterisation.

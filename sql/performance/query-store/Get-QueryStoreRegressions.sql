/*
Script Name : Get-QueryStoreRegressions
Category    : performance
Purpose     : Queries that regressed in the last 24 hours vs their 7-day average CPU/duration.
              Uses Query Store time-bucketed runtime stats to detect "what changed today"
              — queries running >2x slower or using >2x more CPU than their recent baseline.
              Run in the context of the target database (-Database <dbname>).

/*
Script Name : Get-UnusedIndexes
Category    : performance
Purpose     : Identifies non-clustered indexes with zero read activity but non-zero
              write overhead since the last SQL Server restart. These indexes slow
              every INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE on the table without benefiting any query.
              Run in the context of the database you want to audit.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog)
Requires    : VIEW SERVER STATE, VIEW DATABASE STATE
Notes       : Usage stats reset on SQL Server restart — run only after several days
              of representative workload to avoid false positives.
              Do NOT drop without checking all environments — a zero-read index on
              PROD may be critical for a month-end report or a rarely-run job.
              PKs and unique constraints are excluded (structural, cannot be dropped).
              Review write_count vs total_reads ratio. Drop candidates: write_count
              high, total_reads = 0, and size_mb large.

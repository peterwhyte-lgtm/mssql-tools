# SQL layer

This top-level SQL folder is the canonical home for investigation and reporting queries.

Suggested domains:
- performance/ — waits, blocking, long-running queries, I/O, index analysis
- backups/ — backup coverage, restore validation, backup history
- security/ — permission and access reviews
- monitoring/ — health, job, and operational visibility checks
- migration/ — database, login, job, and linked-server inventory for upgrade and estate moves

The canonical working path is now the top-level sql/ layer, with helper and wrapper scripts in helpers/ and powershell/.

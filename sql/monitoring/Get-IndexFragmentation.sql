/*
Script Name : Get-IndexFragmentation
Category    : maintenance-and-reliability
Purpose     : Indexes with significant fragmentation (>= 10%, >= 1000 pages) with recommended action.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog)
Safe        : Read-only
Impact      : Low
Requires    : VIEW DATABASE STATE
Notes       : Run against the target database. Fragmentation on tables under 1000 pages
              is unlikely to affect query performance — those are excluded.

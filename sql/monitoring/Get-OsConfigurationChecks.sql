Script Name : Get-OsConfigurationChecks
Category    : monitoring
Purpose     : DMV-accessible OS and hardware configuration checks: Lock Pages in Memory,
              NUMA topology, scheduler affinity, and Instant File Initialization (SQL 2019+).
              Surfaces common misconfigurations invisible from inside SQL Server.
              Pair with Test-OsConfiguration.ps1 for power plan and page file checks.

Requires    : VIEW SERVER STATE

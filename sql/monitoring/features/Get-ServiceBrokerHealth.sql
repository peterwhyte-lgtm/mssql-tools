Script Name : Get-ServiceBrokerHealth
Category    : monitoring
Purpose     : Service Broker health across all user databases. Orphaned/disconnected
              conversation endpoints accumulate silently over months, eventually degrading
              SB infrastructure. SB is implicitly active on many instances (Database Mail,
              AG health checks use it). Surfaces conversation endpoint counts by state,
              transmission queue depth, and queue activation status.

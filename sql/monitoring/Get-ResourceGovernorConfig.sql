Script Name : Get-ResourceGovernorConfig
Category    : monitoring
Purpose     : Resource Governor configuration — enabled state, resource pools, workload groups,
              and classifier function. An active but misconfigured RG can silently throttle
              queries or starve the DBA's own sessions on an inherited server.

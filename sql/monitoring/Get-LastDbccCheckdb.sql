Script Name : Get-LastDbccCheckdb
Category    : maintenance-and-reliability
Purpose     : Show when each user database last had a successful DBCC CHECKDB run.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog)
Safe        : Read-only
Impact      : Low
Requires    : VIEW ANY DATABASE
Notes       : Uses DATABASEPROPERTYEX('LastGoodCheckDbTime') — available SQL Server 2012+.
              NULL means CHECKDB has never completed successfully on this instance for that database.
              Microsoft recommends running CHECKDB at least weekly.

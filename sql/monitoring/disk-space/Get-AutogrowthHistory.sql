/*
Script Name : Get-AutogrowthHistory
Category    : monitoring
Purpose     : Reads autogrowth events from the SQL Server default trace.
              Autogrowth events during business hours indicate undersized files;
              frequent events indicate the growth increment is too small.
              Use this to right-size initial file sizes and growth increments.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog)
Requires    : VIEW SERVER STATE, ALTER TRACE (to read trace files)
Notes       : Default trace rolls over; history depth depends on server activity.
              Typically covers the last few days to weeks.
              EventClass 92 = Data File Autogrow, 93 = Log File Autogrow.
              Fix: pre-size files to expected peak size and set a fixed MB growth
              increment (not percent) via ALTER DATABASE ... MODIFY FILE.

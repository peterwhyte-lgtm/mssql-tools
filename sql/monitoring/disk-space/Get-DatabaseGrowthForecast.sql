Script Name : Get-DatabaseGrowthForecast
Category    : storage-capacity-management
Purpose     : Project when database files will exhaust their configured size limits,
              using historical file size changes recorded by the DatabaseGrowth temporal collector.
              Calculates MB/day growth rate from the first and last observed size within the
              window, then projects forward to the configured file limit.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog)
Requires    : SELECT on DBAMonitor.collector.DatabaseGrowthCurrent (and its history table)
Depends On  : sql\collectors\Generate-CollectorJob-DatabaseGrowth.sql
              (temporal collector must be installed and collecting for at least 48 hours)
Notes       : Projects file-limit exhaustion only — not physical disk exhaustion.
              One-off bulk loads within @WindowDays inflate the growth rate.
              Reduce @WindowDays to 7 to focus on recent steady-state growth only.
              Files with no size change in the window appear as STABLE (mb_per_day = 0).
              Requires SQL Server 2016 or later.

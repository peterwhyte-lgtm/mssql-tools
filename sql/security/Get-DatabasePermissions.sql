Script Name : Get-DatabasePermissions
Category    : security
Purpose     : Returns all explicit object- and schema-level GRANT/DENY permissions in the
              current database. Shows grantee, permission, object, and grantor. Run in the
              context of each user database — does not iterate across databases.

/*
  DESIGN: sys.database_permissions covers three major classes here:
    DATABASE        — server-level db-scoped permissions (CONNECT, etc.)
    OBJECT_OR_COLUMN — explicit table/view/proc/function grants
    SCHEMA          — schema-level grants that cascade to all objects in the schema
  Column-level permissions (minor_id > 0) are included with the column name resolved.
  Built-in principals (public, sys, INFORMATION_SCHEMA, guest) are excluded.

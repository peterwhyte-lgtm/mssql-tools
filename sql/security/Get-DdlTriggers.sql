Script Name : Get-DdlTriggers
Category    : security
Purpose     : Server-level DDL triggers. These fire on schema changes (CREATE/ALTER/DROP)
              and are often unknown to incoming DBAs. Can block DDL, audit changes, or
              enforce naming conventions — a hidden dependency on inherited servers.

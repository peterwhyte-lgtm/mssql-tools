/*
Script Name : Get-LastNodeBlip
Category    : high-availability
Purpose     : Returns SQL Server error log entries that mention failover, alongside the current
              instance start time. On an FCI, every node blip causes SQL Server to restart on the
              receiving node — sqlserver_start_time is when it last came online.
              If no rows are returned there are no 'failover' entries in the current error log
              archive; use the PowerShell Get-WinEvent approach to query the Windows Failover
              Clustering Operational log directly (see blog post).

/*
Script Name : Get-BackupChainIntegrity
Category    : backups
Purpose     : LSN continuity analysis for each user database. Verifies the log backup chain
              from the most recent full backup to now is unbroken. A gap in the log chain
              means point-in-time restore is impossible for that window — coverage scripts
              only check recency, not continuity. Also surfaces damaged backup sets.

Requires    : SELECT on msdb, VIEW ANY DATABASE

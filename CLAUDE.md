# CLAUDE.md

This file is the working operating guide for this repository.

## Purpose

This repo is a production SQL Server DBA toolkit for Peter Whyte (sqldba.blog). Its job is to help a DBA investigate, troubleshoot, review, and safely operate SQL Server environments.

The repo is built around three core ideas:

1. **Scripts first** — the repo exists to provide usable DBA tooling.
2. **Run it directly when possible** — scripts should be understandable and runnable in isolation.
3. **Docs and outputs matter** — the repo should explain what a script does, what it returns, and what to do next.

The web UI is useful, especially for health checks and discovery, but it is not the primary definition of the repo. The main value is still the scripts, the workflow, and the operational guidance.

## Operating rules

These rules apply across the repo:

- Prefer scripts that can be run from the repo **and** copied/pasted into a normal DBA workflow.
- Default to `.` / localhost unless a server is explicitly supplied.
- Preserve the intent of the script; do not change logic unless needed for safety, correctness, or readability.
- Prefer deterministic, readable, production-safe logic over clever shortcuts.
- Document purpose, permissions, expected output, and when **not** to use a script.
- Keep script docs and script behavior aligned so the output is trustworthy.
- Treat `output-files/` as generated runtime output, not permanent source content.
- Keep scripts easy to understand in isolation, even if the repo provides wrappers or launchers.
- Treat multi-server tooling as optional convenience, not as the main model for every script.
- Avoid overengineering and avoid adding complexity that hides operational intent.

## Naming and classification

- Prefer script names that describe the operational outcome first.
- Use one primary category per script or post.
- If a script is strong enough for a blog post, document it in a way that explains the problem, the output, and the DBA takeaway.
- Prefer one clear post per concept; avoid duplicating similar material.

## How to run scripts

Use the simplest path that preserves clarity:

- a script should be runnable directly from the repo
- a script should also be easy to copy/paste into a DBA workflow
- if a script targets a specific server, the script or wrapper should make that explicit
- the output should be understandable even without the web UI
- another DBA should be able to explain the script confidently during troubleshooting

The preferred entry points are:

```powershell
# 1. Root launcher — fuzzy name match, searches sql/ and powershell/
.\run.ps1 Get-WaitStatistics
.\run.ps1 Get-WaitStatistics -ServerInstance MYSERVER\INST01 -OutputFormat Csv

# 2. Direct wrapper — explicit path, passes all params through
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\powershell\wrappers\performance\Get-WaitStatistics.ps1 -ServerInstance . -OutputFormat Csv

# 3. SQL directly via the repo runner (for SSMS-style results in terminal)
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\local-sql\Invoke-RepoSql.ps1 -ScriptPath .\sql\performance\Get-WaitStatistics.sql -ServerInstance .
```

Full healthcheck workflow:
```powershell
# Collect 32 scripts, save CSVs to output-files\healthcheck\<server>-<timestamp>\
.\powershell\reporting\Invoke-HealthCheckCollection.ps1 -ServerInstance .

# Review the latest collection folder and surface CRITICAL / WARNING / INFO findings
.\powershell\reporting\Review-HealthCheckOutput.ps1

# Or target a specific folder
.\powershell\reporting\Review-HealthCheckOutput.ps1 -FolderPath ".\output-files\healthcheck\.-20260529-185000" -OutputFormat Csv
```

Preflight and discovery:
```powershell
.\tools\triage\Show-RepoOverview.ps1                          # inventory: script counts by category
.\tools\triage\Find-UsefulScript.ps1 -Keyword blocking        # find scripts by keyword
.\tools\local-sql\Test-SqlConnectivity.ps1 -ServerInstance .  # verify SQL connectivity
.\tools\maintenance\Clear-OutputFiles.ps1                     # wipe output-files\ before a fresh run
```

Migration DDL generators:
```powershell
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2019
.\powershell\migration\Generate-LoginScript.ps1
.\powershell\migration\Generate-AgentJobScript.ps1
.\powershell\migration\Generate-UserMappingScript.ps1
# Output: output-files\migration\*.sql
```

## Blog / content guidance

`blog/` is a back-end drafting workspace. It assists Peter in writing posts for sqldba.blog — it has no public-facing output and is not a documentation layer for the repo. The live sqldba.blog post is the public documentation artifact for each script. Links to live posts are added by Peter after publishing, not generated automatically.

The repo should reflect the intended blog taxonomy so that scripts and posts can be organized consistently over time, while keeping the main repo focused on usable DBA tooling.

### Blog category framework

Use the following primary categories when deciding where a script or post belongs:

1. **Core DBA operations**
   - performance
   - monitoring
   - inventory
   - maintenance
   - backup-recovery
   - security
   - high-availability
   - migration-upgrades
   - troubleshooting
2. **Production operations**
   - incident-response
   - capacity-planning
   - change-management
   - data-integrity
   - auditing-compliance
3. **Engineering & architecture**
   - data-architecture
   - diagnostics
   - environment-setup
   - automation
4. **Script ecosystem**
   - scripts
5. **Experimental & learning**
   - labs
6. **Meta / system thinking**
   - engineering-notes
   - ai-systems
7. **Personal / optional**
   - life-work
8. **Future extensions**
   - cloud (inactive unless needed)

This framework is mainly an internal reference model for repo organization and content planning. It does not need to be exposed in a rigid way to every user, but it should guide how scripts and docs are classified and how future content is prioritized.

### Repo structure as blog taxonomy signal

The `sql/<category>/` directory maps to a blog primary category. The `sql/<category>/<subfolder>/` maps loosely to blog tags — not a rigid 1:1, but a directional guide:

| sql/ path | Blog category | Tag signal |
|---|---|---|
| `sql/inventory/` | inventory | instance, databases, services |
| `sql/monitoring/instance/` | monitoring | instance-config, memory |
| `sql/monitoring/databases/` | monitoring | database-health, integrity |
| `sql/monitoring/disk-space/` | monitoring | disk-space, growth, transaction-log, vlf |
| `sql/monitoring/tempdb/` | monitoring | tempdb |
| `sql/monitoring/jobs/` | monitoring | sql-agent |
| `sql/monitoring/error-log/` | monitoring | error-log |
| `sql/monitoring/features/` | monitoring | cdc, query-store, extended-events, service-broker |
| `sql/performance/blocking-locking/` | performance | blocking, locking, deadlocks |
| `sql/performance/indexes/` | performance | indexes, fragmentation |
| `sql/performance/queries/` | performance | query-tuning, plan-cache, statistics |
| `sql/performance/query-store/` | performance | query-store |
| `sql/performance/active-sessions/` | performance | active-sessions |
| `sql/security/access/` | security | logins, users, permissions, roles |
| `sql/security/encryption/` | security | tde, encryption, certificates |
| `sql/high-availability/always-on/` | high-availability | availability-groups |
| `sql/high-availability/replication/` | high-availability | replication |
| `sql/backups/` | backup-recovery | — |
| `sql/migration/` | migration-upgrades | — |

A post series (e.g., wait statistics, index series) can introduce more granular tags than the subfolder suggests — the subfolder is a starting point, not a ceiling.

### Script post standard (for blog-worthy scripts)

Use the following structure when a script is worth publishing as a post:

- **Overview** — what the script does, what problem it solves, when to use it
- **Why This Matters** — real production impact, what breaks without visibility, why DBAs care
- **What The Script Returns** — what the output tells you, without dumping SQL
- **SQL Script** — the full production-ready script, clearly labeled and runnable

### How to choose a primary category

When a script is added or updated, choose the single best primary category based on its main operational intent:

- Use the category that best matches the main question the script answers
- If the script is primarily about investigation, use the category that matches the investigation area
- If the script is primarily about execution or automation, use the category that matches the operational workflow it supports
- If the script is mainly a reusable utility, classify it based on the practical DBA task it helps with, not the implementation detail

A script should not be spread across multiple categories just because it touches several topics.

### Title rules

Use one of these patterns only:
- Get [Thing] for SQL Server
- Check [Thing] in SQL Server
- Analyze [Thing] in SQL Server
- Find [Thing] in SQL Server
- SQL Server [Thing] Overview (rare cases only)

### Content rules

- Do not duplicate a blog post if a similar script already covers the same operational idea
- Prefer one authoritative post per concept; if two scripts overlap, consolidate or clarify the distinction
- Use the repo path to point to the real script location
- Keep the post practical, not promotional, and focused on DBA outcomes
- For similar concepts, prefer a clear distinction such as summary vs detailed drill-down (for example, a high-level summary script and a deeper script should be explained separately)
- When a script is created or refined, classify it under the most appropriate primary category and keep that classification consistent across repo docs and any related post material
- Treat the repo script as the operational artifact and the blog post as the explanatory artifact; they are related, but they are not the same thing

### Additional recommendations

- Add a short note to new scripts explaining what problem they solve, what permissions they need, and when not to use them
- Prefer clear names that describe the DBA outcome, not just the internal implementation path
- Keep the script and its surrounding documentation aligned so a reader can understand both the purpose and the expected output
- If a script is likely to be used often, favour a stable, readable interface over clever shortcuts
- Use the repo taxonomy to guide future planning, but do not let taxonomy become a barrier to practical action
- Aim for scripts that are safe to review quickly by another DBA during an incident
- Prefer defaults that reduce surprise and avoid hidden environment assumptions
- Where a script is likely to be reused, make the expected inputs and outputs obvious from the script name and surrounding comments
- When in doubt, choose the version that is easier to understand, debug, and explain under pressure

## Running against a remote server

All scripts that call `Invoke-RepoSql.ps1` honour three session-level environment variables. Set them once with `Set-SqlConnection.ps1` and every script picks them up automatically for the rest of the session — no need to repeat `-ServerInstance` on every call.

```powershell
# Set remote server for this session (Windows auth)
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2019

# SQL auth (prompts for password)
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01 -Username sa

# Named instance with non-default port
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance "PROD01\INST01,14330"

# See what is currently active
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -Show

# Reset to local (.) Windows auth
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -Clear
```

Or pass `-ServerInstance` directly on any individual call:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 Get-WaitStatistics -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2019
.\powershell\wrappers\performance\Get-WaitStatistics.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2019 -OutputFormat Csv
```

Env vars used internally: `$env:DBASCRIPTS_SERVER`, `$env:DBASCRIPTS_USER`, `$env:DBASCRIPTS_PASS`. Explicit params always win over env vars.

### DDL generator scripts

`powershell/migration/Generate-*.ps1` scripts work differently from normal wrappers — they do **not** go through the CSV pipeline. They call `Invoke-Sqlcmd` with `MaxCharLength 2000000` (or `sqlcmd.exe -y 0`) to capture the full `NVARCHAR(MAX)` DDL string and write it to a `.sql` file in `output-files\migration\`. Never call these through `Invoke-RepoSql.ps1`.

```powershell
# Migration: generate all three scripts from source server
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2019
.\powershell\migration\Generate-LoginScript.ps1
.\powershell\migration\Generate-AgentJobScript.ps1
.\powershell\migration\Generate-UserMappingScript.ps1
# Output: output-files\migration\*.sql  — review, edit owners, run on target
```

## How PowerShell wrappers work

Every thin wrapper in `powershell/wrappers/<category>/*.ps1` follows this pattern:

1. Resolves `$repoRoot` as **three** levels up from `$PSScriptRoot` (wrappers sit at `powershell/wrappers/<category>/`)
2. Builds `$sqlScript = Join-Path $repoRoot 'sql\<category>\<Name>.sql'` (or `sql\migration\` for migration scripts)
3. Delegates to `tools\local-sql\Invoke-RepoSql.ps1` with `-ScriptPath`, `-ServerInstance`, `-Database`, `-OutputFormat`, `-OutputPath`

**Web UI contract:** A SQL script in `sql/` only appears in the web UI if it has a matching wrapper in `powershell/wrappers/<same-category>/<same-subfolder>/` (mirroring the sql/ path exactly). The wrapper IS the web UI entry point — the web UI launches wrappers, not SQL files directly. Every new SQL script must have a paired wrapper at the same relative path under `powershell/wrappers/`.

`Invoke-RepoSql.ps1` tries `Invoke-Sqlcmd` first (SqlServer module), falls back to `sqlcmd.exe`. Always writes a CSV to `output-files\reviews\<category>\<scriptname>-<timestamp>.csv` and prints a table preview. If neither tool is available it throws.

`run.ps1` resolves script by name fuzzy match → `& $target @Arguments`. It searches `powershell/`, `tools/`, `sql/` recursively. Throws if more than one match — callers must be specific.

**PowerShell script rules:**
- Classify script type in `.NOTES`: `runner` / `automation` / `hybrid`
- State target scope: `single server` or `multi-server`
- Classify risk in `.NOTES`: `RiskLevel : SAFE` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH IMPACT`
- Separate SQL logic from orchestration — SQL lives in external `.sql` files
- Add error handling; ensure idempotent behaviour where possible

## SQL script standards

Every SQL script must have this header block then the two safety annotations:

```sql
/*
Script Name : Get-ExampleScript
Category    : performance-troubleshooting
Purpose     : One-line description of what this returns.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog)
Requires    : VIEW SERVER STATE
*/
-- SAFE:ReadOnly
-- IMPACT:Low
SET NOCOUNT ON;
```

`-- SAFE:` values: `ReadOnly` / `WritesData` / `CreatesObjects` — `-- IMPACT:` values: `Low` / `Medium` / `High`

Add `HealthCheck : Yes` (after `Requires`) to any script that runs as part of `Invoke-HealthCheckCollection.ps1`. This tag drives the "Health Check Suite" section in the web UI and makes membership machine-readable without needing a separate folder.

**SQL script rules:**
- Remove or flag unsafe patterns: `WITH (NOLOCK)` (explain risk if present), deprecated catalog views (`sys.sysprocesses`, `sys.sysobjects` etc.)
- Prefer modern DMVs — `sys.objects` not `sys.sysobjects`, `sys.server_principals` not `sys.syslogins`
- No `USE database; GO` — `Invoke-Sqlcmd` does not support `GO` batch separators; pass `-Database` at execution time
- `OUTER APPLY` not `CROSS APPLY` when the applied function may return no rows
- No trailing blank lines; 0–1 blank lines at end of file
- Keep output readable and deterministic


## Adding new scripts

New SQL script: `sql/<category>/<subfolder>/Get-Something.sql` (or `sql/<category>/Get-Something.sql` if it belongs at the category root).

New PS wrapper: copy any existing wrapper from the same level under `powershell/wrappers/`. Path depth rules:
- `powershell/wrappers/<category>/` (root-level scripts) → `$PSScriptRoot '..\..\..'` (3 levels)
- `powershell/wrappers/<category>/<subfolder>/` (subfoldered) → `$PSScriptRoot '..\..\..\..'` (4 levels)
- Update `$sqlScript` to match the sql/ path exactly. The wrapper must be present for the script to appear in the web UI.

Use `New-Wrapper.ps1` to scaffold: it will need the category and subfolder to set the correct depth.

New orchestrator PS script (has real logic, not a thin wrapper): add to `powershell/<subfolder>/` (e.g. `reporting/`, `maintenance/`, `migration/`). Use `$PSScriptRoot '..\..'` to resolve repo root.

**When refactoring an existing script, summarise:** improved script, risk classification (`SAFE` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH IMPACT`), key changes (bullets), suggested folder placement.

**For each major script, document:** purpose in operational terms, example output interpretation, when **not** to use it, required permissions.

`Review-HealthCheckOutput.ps1` reads those CSVs and fires on: databases not ONLINE, missing backups, full backup older than 24h (CRITICAL), stale log backups, tlog >80% used, auto-shrink, auto-close, percent-based autogrowth, DBCC CHECKDB stale >7 days (WARNING) or overdue >14 days / never (CRITICAL), any suspect pages (CRITICAL), SA enabled (CRITICAL), weak SQL login settings, I/O latency >50ms, specific wait type patterns (PAGEIOLATCH, WRITELOG, RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE, CXPACKET), max server memory unconfigured, data files <10% free, VLF count >200 (WARNING) or >1000 (CRITICAL), DBA maintenance job missing/failed/disabled, failed logins (locked accounts and repeated failures), Query Store switched to READ_ONLY, active user Extended Events sessions (INFO), CDC/Change Tracking warnings, and Service Broker CRITICAL/WARNING status.

## Important caveats

- AG scripts (`sql/high-availability/Get-AvailabilityGroupReplicaState.sql`, `Get-AvailabilityGroupLatency.sql`) guard against non-AG instances and return a status row instead of throwing.
- Multi-result-set SQL scripts cannot be cleanly exported as a single CSV via `Invoke-RepoSql.ps1`. All scripts in `sql/` are single-result-set by design.
- `output-files/` CSV files accumulate and should not be committed. Clear with `.\tools\maintenance\Clear-OutputFiles.ps1` before a fresh assessment run.
- `docs/standards.md` is outdated — it shows an older header format. The header in this file is authoritative.
